# Azure WAF Attack Testing Lab Environment Terraform Deployment Template
This Terraform deployment includes everything needed to test Azure WAF Security components.  Below are the differences from the default Azure Network Security deployment template.

- A custom Docker image with a modified version of the OWASP Juice Shop application
- Built-in Azure Firewall rules to allow inbound and outbound connectivity for the Kali VM

This [blogpost](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-network-security-blog/part-1-lab-setup-azure-waf-security-protection-and-detection-lab/ba-p/2030469) provides additional guidance into how this lab works and testing out WAF attack scenarios.  

Update your variables.tf and terraform.tfvars
